# AWS Serverless Computing

## API Gateway, AWS Lambda & DynamoDB

### Severless Development 

Issues with traditional web hosting Apps:
- keep OS and software updated 
- over or under provisioning 
- servers online even if not required 

Serverless benefits:
- Runs on demand (unlimited cap, only pay for code executions)
- scales automatically 
- runs on managed AWS infrastructure 
- great for SPA + API apps (limited support for Fullstack apps)

Useful:
- API application programming interface
- SPA single page application 

### Core serverless services

### Business logic with Lambda and API Gateway

### Data Storage with DynamoDB

### Authentication with Cognito 

### Content delivery & hosting with S3, Cloudfront, and Route53
